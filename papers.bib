  abstract = {Forecasting new cases, hospitalizations, and disease-induced deaths is an important part of infectious disease surveillance and helps guide health officials in implementing effective countermeasures. For disease surveillance in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) combine more than 65 individual forecasts of these numbers in an ensemble forecast at national and state levels. A similar initiative has been launched by the European CDC (ECDC) in the second half of 2021. We collected data on CDC and ECDC ensemble forecasts of COVID-19 fatalities, and we compare them with easily interpretable ``Euler'' forecasts serving as a model-free benchmark that is only based on the local rate of change of the incidence curve. The term ``Euler method'' is motivated by the eponymous numerical integration scheme that calculates the value of a function at a future time step based on the current rate of change. Our results show that simple and easily interpretable ``Euler'' forecasts can compete favorably with both CDC and ECDC ensemble forecasts on short-term forecasting horizons of 1 week. However, ensemble forecasts better perform on longer forecasting horizons. Using the current rate of change in incidences as estimates of future incidence changes is useful for epidemic forecasting on short time horizons. An advantage of the proposed method over other forecasting approaches is that it can be implemented with a very limited amount of work and without relying on additional data (e.g., data on human mobility and contact patterns) and high-performance computing systems.},

  abstract = {En el presente estudio se va a analizar la efectividad de diferentes modelos de aprendizaje autom\'atico con salida probabil\'istica e inferencia Bayesiana, aplicados a la predicci\'on de casos de Covid-19 en Espa\~na. Para ello, se utilizar\'an los datos y las m\'etricas de evaluaci\'on utilizadas en el European Covid-19 Forecast Hub (a partir de ahora, Hub). Dicho Hub est\'a coordinado por el Centro Europeo de Predicci\'on y Control de Enfermedades y se encarga de coleccionar y combinar predicciones a corto plazo de casos, hospitalizaciones y muertes por Covid-19 en toda Europa (Uni\'on Europea, pa\'ises EFTA y UK), generados por diferentes equipos de modelado independientes, utilizando diferentes tipos de metodolog\'ias [1]. Durante el estudio se analizar\'a el rendimiento de modelos predictivos que utilizan diferentes metodolog\'ias, siguiendo un enfoque incremental en cuanto a la complejidad. El an\'alisis se llevar\'a a cabo analizando, tanto los resultados del entrenamiento de los modelos, como la comparaci\'on de las predicciones generadas por los mismos con aquellas predicciones de los modelos existentes en el Hub, utilizando para ello las medidas de evaluaci\'on con las que se eval\'uan semanalmente las predicciones enviadas al Hub. Los modelos estudiados utilizan \'unicamente datos de casos producidos en el pasado, focalizando el estudio, por tanto, en el componente autoregresivo y de dependencia temporal del modelado. El estudio pone especial atenci\'on en la evaluaci\'on y selecci\'on de modelos de regresi\'on. Por tanto, el alcance del estudio es el de analizar hasta qu\'e punto los modelos de regresi\'on probabil\'istica e inferencia bayesiana pueden alcanzar resultados fiables con respecto a modelos predictivos m\'as sofisticados que utilizan conjuntos de datos ampliados con conceptos de epidemiolog\'ia.},

  abstract = {Several epidemiological models have been proposed to study the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we propose an extension of the SUIHTER model, to analyse the COVID-19 spreading in Italy, which accounts for the vaccination campaign and the presence of new variants when they become dominant. In particular, the specific features of the variants (e.g. their increased transmission rate) and vaccines (e.g. their efficacy to prevent transmission, hospitalization and death) are modeled, based on clinical evidence. The new model is validated comparing its near-future forecast capabilities with other epidemiological models and exploring different scenario analyses.},

	abstract = {In the absence of a systematic approach to epidemiological modeling in Slovenia, various isolated mathematical epidemiological models emerged shortly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. We present an epidemiological model adapted to the COVID-19 situation in Slovenia. The standard SEIR model was extended to distinguish between age groups, symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression, and vaccinated or unvaccinated populations. Evaluation of the model forecasts for 2021 showed the expected behavior of epidemiological modeling: our model adequately predicts the situation up to 4 weeks in advance; the changes in epidemiologic dynamics due to the emergence of a new viral variant in the population or the introduction of new interventions cannot be predicted by the model, but when the new situation is incorporated into the model, the forecasts are again reliable. Comparison with ensemble forecasts for 2022 within the European Covid-19 Forecast Hub showed better performance of our model, which can be explained by a model architecture better adapted to the situation in Slovenia, in particular a refined structure for vaccination, and better parameter tuning enabled by the more comprehensive data for Slovenia. Our model proved to be flexible, agile, and, despite the limitations of its compartmental structure, heterogeneous enough to provide reasonable and prompt short-term forecasts and possible scenarios for various public health strategies. The model has been fully operational on a daily basis since April 2020, served as one of the models for decision-making during the COVID-19 epidemic in Slovenia, and is part of the European Covid-19 Forecast Hub.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by Slovenian Research Agency under Research Programme P2-0250 (Grant number ARRS-RPROG-JP_COVID19-Prijava/2020/050).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
